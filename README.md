## Getting Started
It is a project in that you can buy products on different websites but have one basket. In this way, you can use one website to buy from one or many websites. Below is a small demo, or you can use your local to try. </br>
```bash
https://github.com/hpekkan/webappProject.git
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You should start api server: go inside config file and start "nodemon db.js"</br>
